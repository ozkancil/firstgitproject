Collaborators:
we can add collaborators so that people we add has permission and access to push.
we need to clone the code.

TO CLONE:
GO TO file-> project from version control
put your URL u got from your git hub -> Code ->   GO TO file-> project from version control -> URL  HTTPS: https://github.com/ozkancil/firstgitproject.git
NOW collaborator will get exact copy.
NOW GO TO TERMINAL
1. git branch -a
2. git branch ozkan
3. git branch -a
4. git checkout ozkan
5. git branch -a
6. create new file, put note in file, write branch name and save it
7.git add .
8. git commit -m"new batch "ozkan" collaborator"
9.git push-----> BUT DO PUSH UPSTREAM FIRST SO DO
git push --set-upstream origin ozkan -------> we must do this cuz this is a new branch
10. DONE!

we can do git merge main to merge it with main.


============
we should not work on main. we need to create a branch/feature and work on that and push it from that. we add to main
after we push, merge into github then pull into main.
remote master will do pull request or we do it,  but they must approve the pull request.

when u do git pull it will get remote git hub.
if u do git merge main it will merge it with local.
if u dont have the latest code from github u cannot push. you must pull first.
